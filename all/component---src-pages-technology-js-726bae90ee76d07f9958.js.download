To send a message or invoke a smart contract function cross-chain, a user or a dApp will first send their intention as a message with a structured header and arbitrary binary payload to a Message Bus smart contract on the source chain. Then the validator, the State Guardian Network, will first reach a consensus on the existence of such a message and concurrently generate a stake-weighed multi-signature attestation. This attestation then is relayed to the destination via an Executor subscribing to the message. On the destination chain, the same Message Bus contract exists to check the validity of the message and triggers the corresponding logic associated with the message either immediately or after a timeout.
